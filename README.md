Glass Shards
=========
**For the version for Minecraft 1.7 see [ljfa-ag/Glass-Shards](https://github.com/ljfa-ag/Glass-Shards).**

This is a small Minecraft mod which only adds one item to the game: Glass shards.  
You randomly get glass shards by breaking glass or glass panes. The chance is configurable, and glass panes only give 3/8 as much as glass blocks.  
You can smelt glass shards in a furnace to get your glass back.  
Stained glass and panes drop stained glass shards. They can be recolored using dyes, or you can use Gunpowder to remove the color.
