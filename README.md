This is a small Minecraft mod which makes glass blocks drop glass shards. 
You randomly get glass shards by breaking glass or glass panes. The chance is configurable, and glass panes only give 3/8 as much as glass blocks.  
You can smelt glass shards in a furnace to get your glass back.  
Stained glass and panes drop stained glass shards. They can be recolored using dyes, or you can use Gunpowder to remove the color.
